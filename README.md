# Cantonese in Communication Vocab Lists
In this repository you will find a csv. digital versions of all the vocab lists found within the "Cantonese in Communication: Listening and Speaking (邊學邊用: 粤語聽說教材)" books: [Book 1](https://aims.cuhk.edu.hk/converis/portal/detail/Publication/149741601?auxfun=&lang=zh_HK), [Book 2](https://aims.cuhk.edu.hk/converis/portal/detail/Publication/149691412?auxfun=&lang=zh_HK), and [Book 3](https://aims.cuhk.edu.hk/converis/portal/detail/Publication/149742543?auxfun=&lang=zh_HK)

## About
The series is designed to help learners progressively develop their listening and speaking skills in Cantonese. It uses real-life scenarios, common vocabulary, and practical exercises to facilitate learning. The series also provides detailed explanations of Cantonese grammar and usage. Each book in the series builds upon the previous one, introducing more complex vocabulary and grammar as the series progresses. This allows learners to gradually improve their Cantonese skills, starting from basic communication and moving towards fluency.

## Listening Practice
Each lesson has a designated dialogue using the vocab lists. Here are the mp3 files:

# Information
## Disclaimer
I used the [PyCantonese](https://pycantonese.org/) library to convert the Chinese Characters into Jyutping, and then regenerated the Yale romanization. I noticed that some of the tones were different, but I decided to stick with what PyCantonese provided rather than the book as checking each vocab individually would take too long.
