# Book 3 Audio
There are 10 lessons, and each lesson has 3 different file types. The files names are formatted like so: `L{num}_{section}_{part}{type}.ogg`.

For lessons 1 to 10, the `num` value will go from `L1` to `L10`.

The `section` represents the section in the text book's lesson chapter. The `part` is optional, but it represents a sub-section within the section. Both the `section` and `part` represent the headings within the lesson for reference.

The 5 different types of audio are:
* Texts: `Text`
* Vocabulary in use: `Vocinuse`
* Listening and speaking: `Listeningcomprehension`
* Additional Text: `AdditionalText`
* Authentic Oral Data: `Authenticoraldata`
  * Per lesson, there's between 2-3 of the authentic oral data audio

For example:
* `L5_7_1Listeningcomprehension.ogg` is the audio for Lesson 5 Section 7 Part 1 Listening Compression
* `L8_8_6Authenticoraldata2.ogg` is the audio for Lesson 8 Section 8 Part 6 Autentic Oral Data #2
* `L6_2Text.ogg` is the audio for Lesson 6 Section 2 Text
