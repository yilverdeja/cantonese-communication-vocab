# Book 2 Audio
There are 10 lessons, and each lesson has 3 different file types. The files names are formatted like so: `L{num}_{type}.mp3`.

For lessons 1 to 10, the `num` value will go from `L1` to `L10`.

The three different types of audio are:
* Texts: `text`
* Vocabulary in use: `voc`
* Listening and speaking: `L_S`

For example:
* `L4_text.mp3` is the audio for Lesson 4 texts
* `L1_L_S.mp3` is the audio for Lesson 1 listening & speaking
* `L5_voc.mp3` is the audio for Lesson 5 vocabulary in use

In addition to the 10 lessons, there are audio files for 2 additional sections:
1. Mid-term Review (L1 to L5): `RL1_5_text.mp3`
2. General Review (L1 to L10): `RL1_10_text.mp3`
